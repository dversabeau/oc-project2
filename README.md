# OlympicGames Project

Don't forget to install your node_modules before starting (`npm install`).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

I choose to use Plotly.js for the chart part of the project because it was compatible with my version of Angular and the documentation is really well-made and exhaustive, it helped me a lot.
